Reward Campaign Vault System
A decentralized reward distribution system built on Ethereum that allows creators to set up token-based reward campaigns with secure, automated distribution mechanisms.
Overview
The Reward Campaign Vault System consists of two main contracts that work together to provide a secure and efficient way to manage token-based reward campaigns:

Factory Contract: Deploys and manages individual campaign vaults using minimal proxy clones for gas efficiency
Vault Contract: Handles individual campaign funding, storage, and reward distribution

Key Features
üè≠ Factory Contract

Campaign Creation: Deploy new reward campaigns as gas-efficient minimal proxy clones
Token Allowlist: Maintain a whitelist of approved ERC20 tokens for campaigns
Fee Management: Configurable fee system with fees collected by a Safe multisig wallet (2/4 signer threshold)
Distributor Management: Reward distribution managed by a Safe multisig wallet (2/4 signer threshold)
Upgrade Mechanism: Update vault implementation for new campaigns without affecting existing ones

üè¶ Vault Contract

Secure Funding: Campaign creators fund their vaults with approved ERC20 tokens
Automated Fee Deduction: Fees are automatically deducted during funding and sent to the Safe multisig wallet
Batch Reward Distribution: Distribute rewards to multiple recipients in a single transaction
Campaign Finalization: One-time reward distribution with permanent campaign closure
Token Recovery: Rescue mechanism for accidentally sent tokens

Architecture
Factory Contract
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Creates minimal proxy clones of Vault implementation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Manages token allowlist and fee configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Authorizes Safe multisig wallet (2/4 signer threshold) as reward distributor
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Sends fees to Safe multisig wallet (2/4 signer threshold)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Tracks all deployed campaigns

Vault Contract (Proxy)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Initialized by Factory with campaign-specific parameters
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Funded by campaign creator with approved tokens
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Distributes rewards via Safe multisig wallet (2/4 signer threshold)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Finalizes campaign after distribution

Workflow

Campaign Creation: User calls createCampaign() on Factory
Vault Deployment: Factory deploys a minimal proxy clone of Vault
Campaign Funding: Creator funds the vault with approved ERC20 tokens
Fee Processing: Factory fee is automatically deducted and sent to the Safe multisig wallet (2/4 signer threshold)
Reward Distribution: Safe multisig wallet (2/4 signer threshold) distributes rewards to recipients
Campaign Finalization: Vault is permanently finalized after distribution

Security Features

Access Control: Only the Safe multisig wallet (2/4 signer threshold) can distribute rewards
One-Time Distribution: Campaigns can only be finalized once
Token Allowlist: Only pre-approved tokens can be used for campaigns
Initialization Protection: Vaults cannot be re-initialized after deployment
Safe Token Transfers: Uses OpenZeppelin's SafeERC20 for secure token operations

Gas Optimization

Minimal Proxy Pattern: Reduces deployment costs by ~90% compared to full contract deployment
Batch Operations: Distribute rewards to multiple recipients in single transaction
Efficient Storage: Optimized state variable packing and access patterns

Foundry Development Environment
This project uses Foundry, a blazing fast, portable and modular toolkit for Ethereum application development written in Rust.
Foundry consists of:

Forge: Ethereum testing framework (like Truffle, Hardhat and DappTools)
Cast: Swiss army knife for interacting with EVM smart contracts, sending transactions and getting chain data
Anvil: Local Ethereum node, akin to Ganache, Hardhat Network
Chisel: Fast, utilitarian, and verbose solidity REPL

Contract Addresses
After deployment, update this section with the deployed contract addresses:
Factory: 0x...
Vault Implementation: 0x...
Safe Multisig Wallet: 0x...

Usage Examples
Creating a Campaign
// 1. Deploy or get Factory contract instance
IFactory factory = IFactory(FACTORY_ADDRESS);

// 2. Create a new campaign
address vaultAddress = factory.createCampaign();

Funding a Campaign
// 1. Get vault instance
IVault vault = IVault(vaultAddress);

// 2. Approve tokens for transfer
IERC20(tokenAddress).approve(vaultAddress, fundingAmount);

// 3. Fund the vault (fees are automatically deducted)
vault.fund(tokenAddress, fundingAmount);

Distributing Rewards
// 1. Prepare reward array
IVault.Reward[] memory rewards = new IVault.Reward[](2);
rewards[0] = IVault.Reward(recipient1, amount1);
rewards[1] = IVault.Reward(recipient2, amount2);

// 2. Distribute rewards (only Safe multisig wallet with 2/4 signer threshold)
vault.distributeRewards(rewards);

Usage
Build
$ forge build

Test
$ forge test

Format
$ forge fmt

Gas Snapshots
$ forge snapshot

Anvil
$ anvil

Deploy
Quick Start with Makefile
This project includes a Makefile for simplified operations. First, create your environment configuration:
# Create .env template
$ make env-template

# Copy and edit the template
$ cp .env.template .env
# Edit .env with your actual values

Then deploy using the Makefile:
# Deploy to configured network
$ make deploy

# Or deploy to specific networks
$ make deploy-local    # Local Anvil
$ make deploy-testnet  # Testnet
$ make deploy-mainnet  # Mainnet (with safety prompts)

Manual Deployment
Alternatively, deploy manually with Forge:
$ forge script script/vault/DeployFactory.s.sol:DeployFactory --rpc-url $RPC_URL --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY --broadcast --verify

The deployment addresses will be saved to deployment-addresses-{NETWORK}.txt.
